                    <p>
                        The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an
                        international forum for researchers with interests in all aspects of
                        functional programming, taking a broad view of current and future
                        trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for
                        presenting the latest research results, and other contributions.

                        <h2>Scope</h2>
                        <p>
                      The symposium recognizes that new trends may arise through various routes. As part of the Symposium's focus on trends we therefore identify the following five article categories. High-quality articles are solicited in any of these categories:
                      <ul>
                      <li><b>Research Articles:</b><br>
                      Leading-edge, previously unpublished research work;
                      <li><b>Position Articles:</b><br>
                      On what new trends should or should not be;
                      <li><b>Project Articles:</b><br>
                      Descriptions of recently started new projects;
                      <li><b>Evaluation Articles:</b><br>
                      What lessons can be drawn from a finished project;
                      <li><b>Overview Articles:</b><br>
                      Summarizing work with respect to a trendy subject.
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                      Articles must be original and not simultaneously submitted for publication to any other forum. They may consider any aspect of functional programming: theoretical, implementation-oriented, or experience-oriented. Applications of functional programming techniques to other languages are also within the scope of the symposium.
                      <p>
                      Topics suitable for the symposium include, but are not limited to:
                      <ul>
                      <li>Functional programming and multicore/manycore computing
                      <li>Functional programming in the cloud
                      <li>High performance functional computing
                      <li>Extra-functional (behavioural) properties of functional programs
                      <li>Dependently typed functional programming
                      <li>Validation and verification of functional programs
                      <li>Debugging and profiling for functional languages
                      <li>Functional programming in different application areas:
                      <li>security, mobility, telecommunications applications, embedded
                      <li>systems, global computing, grids, etc.
                      <li>Interoperability with imperative programming languages
                      <li>Novel memory management techniques
                      <li>Program analysis and transformation techniques
                      <li>Empirical performance studies
                      <li>Abstract/virtual machines and compilers for functional languages
                      <li>(Embedded) domain specific languages
                      <li>New implementation strategies
                      <li>Any new emerging trend in the functional programming area
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                      If you are in doubt on whether your article is within the scope of
                      TFP, please contact the TFP 2020 program
                      chairs, <a href="mailto:rjmh@chalmers.se?subject=TFP Scope Enquiry">John Hughes</a> or

                      <h2>Best Paper Awards</h2>
                      <p>
                      To reward excellent contributions, TFP awards a prize for the best paper accepted for the formal proceedings.
                      <p>
                      TFP traditionally pays special attention to research students, acknowledging that students are almost by definition part of new subject trends. A student paper is one for which the authors state that the paper is mainly the work of students, the students are listed as first authors, and a student presented the paper at the symposium. A prize for the best student paper is awarded each year.
                      <p>
                      In both cases, it is the PC of TFP that awards the prize. In case the
                      best paper also happens to be a student paper, that paper will receive
                      both prizes. Here is a list of  <a href="http://www.trendsfp.com/tifp/best-student-paper.html"
                      target="_blank">previous award winners</a>.
                      
                      <h2>Paper Submissions</h2>
                      <p>
                      We use EasyChair for the refereeing process. Papers must be submitted at:
                      <p>
                        <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2020" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tfp2020</a>
                      
                      <p>
                        Authors have <i>three opportunities</i> to submit their work to TFP:
                        <table style="width: 100%">
                          <tr>
                            <td>Submission deadline for pre-symposium review</td>
                            <td style="color:red">15th November, 2019</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>Submission deadline for draft papers</td>
                            <td style="color:red">10th January, 2020</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>Submission deadline for post-symposium reviewing</td>
                            <td style="color:red">20th March, 2020</td>
                          </tr>
                          </table>
                      
                      <p>
                        Papers submitted for pre-symposium review will be reviewed by the programme committee, and may be
                        <ul>
                          <li><b>accepted for inclusion in the proceedings</b>, or
                            <li><b>accepted for presentation at the symposium</b>.
                        </ul>
                      <p>
                        Draft papers submitted for the second deadline will be lightly reviewed, and may be <b>accepted for presentation at the symposium</b>, but cannot be accepted for inclusion in the proceedings at this stage.
                      <p>
                        Every accepted paper should be presented at the symposium by one of
                        the authors (including papers which are already accepted for the proceedings).
                      <p>
                        Papers which were presented at the symposium may be submitted for
                        post-symposium review by the programme committee, and may then
                        be <b>accepted for inclusion in the proceedings</b>. Papers which
                        were accepted for the proceedings during the first review round
                        should not be resubmitted--they will automatically be included,
                        provided they were presented at the symposium.
                      
                      <p>
                        All papers accepted for inclusion in the proceedings, after either
                        the first or the third reviewing round, should be revised to address
                        the reviewers' concerns, and resubmitted for the camera-ready
                        deadline; there is around a month after the final notification
                        available to do so. We expect the proceedings to be published in
                        mid-August.
                      
                        <p><b>We strongly encourage authors to submit their work for the
                        first deadline</b>. Authors whose papers are accepted for
                        presentation, but not immediately for the proceedings in this first
                        round, will have <i>more than two months</i> to address the
                        reviewers' concerns, including an opportunity to present and discuss
                        the work at the symposium itself, before resubmitting for the final
                        round of reviewing. This should improve the chances of final
                        acceptance considerably. Papers submitted for the first deadline
                        will also have priority for the presentation slots at the symposium.
                      
                        
                        <h3>Paper categories</h3>
                      
                      <p> Draft papers and papers submitted for formal review are either
                      submitted as <i>extended abstracts</i> (4 to 10 pages in length) or as <i>full
                      papers</i> (20 pages). The submission must clearly indicate which category
                      it belongs to: <i>research</i>, <i>position</i>, <i>project</i>, <i>evaluation</i>, or <i>overview</i>
                      paper. It should also indicate which authors are research students,
                        and whether the main author(s) are students.
                        
                        <h3>Format</h3>
                        <p>
                          Papers must be written in English, and written using the LNCS style. For more information about formatting please consult the <a href="http://www.springer.com/lncs" target="_blank">Springer LNCS web site</a>.

                          Springer encourages authors to include
                          their <a href="https://goo.gl/hbsa4D">ORCIDs</a> in their
                          papers. For the final proceedings, the corresponding
                          author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of
                          that paper, will need to complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish
                          form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should
                          match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files
                          have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of
                          the papers cannot be made.
                      
                          We will offer, but not mandate, open access publication via
