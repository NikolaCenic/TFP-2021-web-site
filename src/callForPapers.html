                        <p>The symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP) is an international forum for
                            researchers
                            with interests in all aspects of functional programming, taking a broad view of current and
                            future trends in the area. It aspires to be a lively environment for presenting the latest
                            research results, and other contributions. See the call for papers for more details.</P>

                        <p>This year, TFP is moving to a winter date, to provide an opportunity for researchers in the
                            FP
                            community to meet and interact in between the annual <a
                                href="https://www.icfpconference.org/" target="_blank">ICFP</a> events.</p>
                        <p> TFP offers a friendly and constructive reviewing process designed to help less experienced
                            authors
                            succeed, with an opportunity for two rounds of review, both before and after the symposium
                            itself.
                            Authors thus have an opportunity to address reviewers' concerns before the final decision on
                            publication in the Proceedings is taken, in the light of previous reviews and discussions at
                            the
                            symposium.</p>

                        <p>
                            TFP offers two "<a href="http://www.trendsfp.com/tifp/best-student-paper.html"
                                target="_blank">best paper</a>" awards, the John McCarthy award for best paper, and the
                            David Turner
                            award for best student paper.

                        <p> This year we are particularly excited to co-locate with <a
                                href="https://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2020" target="_blank">Lambda Days</a> in
                            beautiful Budapest.

                            Lambda
                            Days
                            is a vibrant developer conference with hundreds of attendees and a lively programme of talks
                            on
                            functional programming in practice. TFP will be held in the same venue, and participants
                            will be
                            able to session-hop between Lambda Days and TFP, and meet developers excited about
                            functional
                            programming in industry.</p>
